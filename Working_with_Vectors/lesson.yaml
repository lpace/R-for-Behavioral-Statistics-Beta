  Output: Dr. Larry here again. In this lesson you will learn more about working with both numeric and character vectors. There are actually six different kinds of vectors in R. They are integer, real, character, logical, complex, and raw. These are called "atomic" vectors in R, but don't worry, they're not explosive!

- Class: text
  Output: As you learned in your previous lesson, to R a single number or character is also a vector. R uses a recycling property to go through the elements of a vector, and when you work with vectors of different lengths, this can make many statistical computations easier.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's use a shortcut feature of R to get a sequence of integers from 1 to 10. At the command prompt, type x <- 1:10 and press Enter."
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 1:10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'x <- 1:10')
  Hint: Type x <- 1:10 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As we did in our previous lesson, check the structure of x by typing str(x) and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: str(x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'str(x)')
  Hint: Type str(x) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Every element of a vector has an index, and we can use these indexes to subset, add, replace, and remove vector elements. This works with both character and numeric vectors. For example, type x[1:5] to see the first five elements of x.
  CorrectAnswer: x[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'x[1:5]')
  Hint: Type x[1:5] and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's create a character vector to go along with our vector of integers. We will use another R shortcut. R already knows the alphabet, and has the letters programmed into it. We can get the first 10 letters by simply asking for them. Let's create a vector called y with these 10 letters. At the command prompt, type y <- letters[1:10] and press Enter. Note the square brackets."
  CorrectAnswer: y <- letters[1:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'y <- letters[1:10]')
  Hint: Type y <- letters[1:10] and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As we did with x, let's look at the first five elements of y. Type y[1:5] and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: y[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'y[1:5]')
  Hint: Type y[1:5] and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Note that R encloses character strings and single characters in quotation marks. When you try to mix data types in a vector, R will coerce the data to a single type. For example, if you were to try to make a vector with numbers and characters, the entire vector would become a character vector. To see this, combine x and y by typing z <- c(x, y).
  CorrectAnswer: z <- c(x, y)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'z <- c(x, y)')
  Hint: Type z <- c(x, y) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Check the structure of z by typing str(z) and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: str(z)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'str(z)')
  Hint: Type str(z) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Yes, z is a character vector, and the numbers are now represented as characters. It is important to remember that a vector can contain only one type of data. To remove an unwanted object from your workspace, use the rm() for remove function. Let's get rid of z, as we will not need it any longer. At the command prompt, type rm(z) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: rm(z)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'rm(z)')
  Hint: Type rm(z) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's use indexes with our numeric vector. For example, we can substitute or replace a value by using the index. Remember x is a the vector of integers from 1 to 10, so the indexes match the values in this contrived example. Say we want to replace x[5] with the value NA, which is used to indicate missing data in R. Type x[5] <- NA and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: x[5] <- NA
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[5] <- NA')
  Hint: Type x[5] <- NA and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's examine x again. Type x and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Type x and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: NA is a special character in R, and it is the only code recognized by R for missing data. If you are working with data from another application that uses some other way to code missing data, you will need to recode the missing values to NA, either in that other application, or in R, in order to be able to use the data in R. We will discuss this matter in more depth in our upcomining lesson on subsetting and recoding data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For now, let's reassign the correct value to x[5]. Type x[5] <- 5 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: x[5] <- 5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'x[5] <- 5')
  Hint: Type x[5] <- 5 and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: In addition to indexes, vector elements can also have names. To see this in operation, we will use our vector of letters as names for our vector of numbers.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: At the command prompt, type names(x) <- y and then press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: names(x) <- y
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(x) <- y')
  Hint: Type names(x) <- y and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, check the contents of x again. Type x and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'x')
  Hint: Type x and press Enter.
